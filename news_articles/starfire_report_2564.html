<p><b>NanoTrasen Freedom of Information Suit Settled</b></p>

<p>So if you’re the sort to closely follow legal proceedings you might know we here at Starfire have been engaged in a lawsuit with NanoTrasen for a couple years now. But if you’re not a lawyer, well, now you know. We can’t get into the details other than to say we settled and settled favorably since the terms of settlement involve us not reporting on the details of the case.</p>
<p>What we can tell you is part of the settlement requires NanoTrasen to provide free access to our station which is the main point of this article. If you’re a new NT reader checking us out for the first time, welcome! We are the Starfire Report, an independent news agency committed to covering stories in the Vir system and beyond. We are not part of NanoTrasen and will disclose if any stories are sponsored by NanoTrasen.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for access to our channel (maybe you’re reading this on a friend’s device), just ask NanoTrasen for a Starcaster and you’ll be given one free of charge. We look forward to keeping you informed and up to date.</p>

<p><b>NanoTrasen Asset Protection Deployed</b></p>

<p>Panic struck NCS Northern Star late last night as an explosion rocked the station shortly after Central Command received an anonymous tip warning about a covert Syndicate attack. Unprepared for an actual attack (“We get about thirty of these tips daily. Usually it’s just spam from bored teens,” stated Northern Star Chief of Security), NanoTrasen rapidly deployed a reserve Emergency Response Team and an Asset Protection team just returned from anti-piracy raids.</p>
<p>Details of the assault are vague at best. Eyewitness testimony describes a NanoTrasen-branded drop pod smashing through the ceiling and releasing a dozen heavily-armed men, a Dark Gygax, and a Phazon. “’We’re not going to let those ERT fucks beat us to the punch!’ They kept chanting that while running down the hallway, shutters dropping as everything vented through the hole in the ceiling,” remarked the eyewitness (who requested anonymity out of fear of Asset Protection). “Running and shooting. I couldn’t hear the gunshots soon after the shutters went down but I did hear a couple more dull booms. I just assumed it was the guy with the RPG.”</p>
<p>The Emergency Response Team chose a different approach. “I went for the cameras. It’s a bad idea to go in guns blazing, Syndicates usually expect that and you end up with casualties,” Lt. Karora shared over a communicator call. As part of NT’s mysterious PCRU division, Karora specializes in reducing the risk of NT crews opening fire on ERT units. “Plus CC’s message was rushed and incoherent, it was a good indicator they didn’t know what we were dealing with. The recordings were pretty clear, some idiot brought a Durand over from Southern Cross during crew transfer and shot a missile before clearing out. Nothing nefarious at all, just incompetence.”</p>
<p>”But then Asset Protection ran into view and opened fire. Ballistics, lasers, grenades. The Durand was a pile of scrap in seconds but they just kept firing. They didn’t stop and check until half the docks were gone. Then they left. The whole thing has been a massive embarrassment. That’s thousands in damage because somebody took a joyride in a combat mech.”</p>
<p>Asset Protection had only one comment to share with us. “A fucking Durand!”</p>

<p><b>The Mysteries of the Void (Guest Piece)</b></p>

<p>Despite its ubiquity in every facet of modern life, the riddles and nature of outer space and the wider universe continue to defy our understanding and demonstrate how little we truly know about the mysteries of existence. We dig up ancient civilizations with physics-defying technology and simply chalk it to “redspace” as if that explains their nature. We gather phoron to warp time and space in inexplicable ways without pausing to consider what scars we tear into the fabric of reality.</p>
<p>What shall we do when things beyond comprehension crawl through the holes we tear and further fray the fabric? Cover it up like NanoTrasen’s attempts to hide demonic incursions into the crew of NLS Southern Cross? Shall we continue hiding it as evidence piles too high to ignore, as the foundations of daily life erode and collapse? Just today Southern Cross was visited by a faction wielding reality-bending technology so potent we would call it magic. Just today NanoTrasen once again denied the anomalous events even as crew insist otherwise. Once again eye witnesses are regarded as madmen as those with wealth throw a shroud over truth.</p>
<p>But you, dear reader, shall likely brush me aside like every other inconvenient truth you walked over today. Until, of course, a demon manifests on your doorstep.</p>

<p><b>What Happened to Culinary Arts? (Guest Piece)</b></p>

<p>You’d think everybody would have food straight in this day and age but we still don’t. I don’t know what it is with space-farers but they just cram everything they can find into a microwave and hope it spits out delicious meals. I don’t care how good the result looks, it’s just not going to taste as good as anything made by a proper chef.</p>
<p>The crew on Southern Cross are some of Sif’s worst offenders. Earlier today some guy created a burrito bigger than a teshari by just cramming shit into a microwave until it’s ready to burst. The thing is so massive you could smash a windshield with it. Given it came out of a microwave I bet the inside is frozen enough to do so.</p>
<p>Come on people, microwaves aren’t the future. Make some real food already.</p>

<p><b>Spiders Swarm Ullran Expanse</b></p>

<p>Invasive giant spiders swarmed the Ullran Expanse in record numbers late last night. Estimated to number in the thousands, the swarm devoured all indigenous wildlife and assaulted personnel within NanoTrasen’s secretive Ullran outpost. The full extent of the damage to the local ecosystem remains unknown and will likely be a major component of next month’s VGA State of Sif Address in New Reykjavik.</p>
<p>The cause of the spider surge remains unknown but was quickly brought under control by an extermination effort from Southern Cross crew. Led by NT’s PCRU division, Southern Cross personnel engaged in a bloody, hours long war which left the Ullran plains covered in gore and spider remains. Eyewitness testimony suggests the swarm has been eradicated; tentative surveys throughout the day suggest giant spider numbers have dropped back to the pre-swarm population.</p>
<p>”As the only permanent installation in the Ullran Expanse, we saw it as our duty to ensure the spider infestation could not spread and wreck further havoc,” stated an NanoTrasen spokesperson. “We take Sif’s ecological record very seriously. Negligence by unreputable corporations gave giant spiders a foothold on Sif. Allowing them to overrun the wilds just isn’t an option. If that means we alone have to stand against [the spiders], then so be it.”</p>
<p>The cause of the infestation remains a source of speculation. Several sources directly involved in the eradication state an experimental weapon designed by the Syndicate attracted the spiders as a targeted attack against Southern Cross and a blunder by the PCRU squad prevented the device from being destroyed before activation. The NT spokesperson dismissed these rumors as “ludicrous” and stated the PCRU was not involved due to preemptive knowledge of the situation but because they were the only squad in the Vir system at the time of the attack.</p>
<p>Myelamine prices have hit an all-time low on Sif.</p>

<p><b>Volcanic Ash Settles</b></p>

<p>A massive cloud of volcanic ash finally dispersed today. A recent volcanic eruption resulted in an ash cloud thick enough to blot out all sunlight over the Ullran Expanse. While the ash has not completely settled out, enough has washed to the ground to once again allow sunlight to reach the earth.</p>
<p>The ash cloud has been unusual in persisting almost entirely over the Ullran Expanse and nowhere else on Sif. NanoTrasen has declined to comment on whether or not testing in their Ullran facility may have been linked to this atmospheric anomaly.</p>

<p><b>Ullran Outpost Renovated (Sponsored by NanoTrasen)</b></p>

<p>Due to employee feedback, NanoTrasen has decided to fully renovate its Ullran Expanse installation. Formerly several distinct buildings haphazardly scattered about, the new outpost is an interconnected unit kept secure behind a chain-link fence.</p>
<p>The new outpost features a plethora of improvements for leisurely activity. From extended sleeping quarters to a boxing ring, new pool, and sauna, crew are certain to be pleased with the renovations. Ships now land inside to avoid the cold and fishing is now just a short walk from the southern airlocks.</p>
<p>”We take the emotional wellbeing of our employees very seriously,” commented an official NT spokesperson. “What better way to show our appreciation than to provide better facilities for taking a break? We’re certain this will improve morale and boost productivity.”</p>

<p><b>Rampant AI Strikes</b></p>

<p>A swarm of unbranded hive bots swarmed NLS Southern Cross late last night, reportedly due to either a container crashing into the station or an unidentified ship docking with it. NanoTrasen crew valiantly fought off the rogue swarm; an official NT spokesman insists the mysterious swarm has been completely destroyed and there is no risk of further attack.</p>
<p>Eyewitness testimony from Southern Cross crew suggests the hive pursued a group of unlawed cyborgs to Southern Cross but offered no unanimous answers as to why a hivebot swarm targeted a group of cyborgs. Some suggested the cyborgs were an advanced form of hivebot, others stated the hivebot swarm acted at the behest of a corrupted AI seeking to take prisoners. Another common theme was the aid of an outside agent but no crew could provide details about this unknown entity.</p>
<p>This attack has fueled concerns about the dangers of replicating low-intelligence AI. Occasionally used in pirate extortion tactics, hivebots are aggressive autonomous robots which can self-replicate in environments with abundant steel and can be difficult to eradicate. Evidence of hivebots mounting largescale attacks without directive from sapient life is rare. The possibility of a hivebot swarm developing advanced intelligence with the capability of travelling between planets is a cause for alarm.</p>
<p>SolGov is expected to release a statement regarding the hivebots later in the week.</p>

<p><b>Grayson Class Action Suit Settled</b></p>

<p>A decades-long class action lawsuit against Grayson Manufactories Ltd. has finally reached an out-of-court settlement. For those of you not in the know, Grayson was implicated in a scandal fifty years ago over their standard line of workhorse ore refineries. Due to a flaw in the phoron compressing chamber, processing phoron with a Grayson refinery produced trace amounts of an unknown highly neurotoxic gas. Studies since this discovery have determined the gas is a chronic toxin at the levels workers were exposed to, now known to trigger neurological disorders and neural degradation over long term exposure. The gas is particularly nefarious by almost entirely lacking unique exposure symptoms; the only telltale symptom of exposure is an auditory hallucination where all footsteps sound like walking over a metal hull. This particular symptom has fueled countless conspiracy theories about all planets secretly being ancient hollow spacecraft.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Grayson allegedly produced faulty refineries with knowledge of the toxic byproduct and attempted to cover up its knowledge of the flaw once discovered by the general public. The terms of the settlement remain private but do not involve Grayson publicly admitting fault for the millions of workers irreversibly harmed by faulty phoron refineries. If you have been diagnosed with a neurological disorder and have worked in a phoron processing facility with a Grayson refinery, you have up to 30 days to claim compensation from Grayson’s exonet site. Persistence is recommended as the site has been down due to heavy traffic since the settlement was announced last week.</p>
<p>Emboldened by the settlement, workers at NanoTrasen began organizing a class action lawsuit due to reports of similar symptoms at NT facilities. Curiously, tests conducted at NT facilities over the previous several days found no trace of the neurotoxic gas. Workers stated the hallucinations had subsided but were present just last week. Accusations abound that NT rectified the issue just before the Grayson case settled to prevent a similar lawsuit but no record exists of NT recently upgrading its refineries or of its refineries having ever produced the gas.</p>
<p>NanoTrasen insists it has always used a proprietary refinery design which never produced toxic gas. Workers claim otherwise, dredging up years of accusations from Grayson that NT’s mining equipment not only violates Grayson patents but copies Grayson designs down to the smallest detail. Unfortunately for workers, medical records of nonspecific neurological symptoms are the only hard evidence the lawsuit possesses. Without more evidence, the lawsuit shall likely collapse by next month.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists claim Grayson deliberately utilized a faulty refinery design to ensure NanoTrasen would steal a faulty model. Like all legal battles against trans-stellar corporations, accusations abound while documentation goes missing.</p>

<p><b>Anomalies Smash Outpost</b></p>

<p>Once again we see NanoTrasen’s Ullran Expanse installment featuring in our column. This time it’s due to a peculiar meteor shower allegedly made up of mysterious anomalous artifacts which smashed directly into the outpost while leaving the vast empty expanse of the surrounding plains untouched. At least if the crew are to be believed, NT is remaining tight-lipped and will only confirm “objects” destroyed the installation.</p>
<p>According to the crew, a ship of vox lost the objects in some sort of attack and needed to retrieve them to make repairs and leave. Said vox crew was apparently secretive and openly suspicious of Southern Cross’s crew, enough so one Cargo Technician to request advice on how to submit a Hurt Feelings Report. Given both NanoTrasen and SolGov’s track record with vox (the latter doesn’t even offer vox basic sapient rights!), this is both expected and likely warranted.</p>
<p>Why NanoTrasen refuses to comment on this incident is anybody’s guess. Were they planning to steal something from the vox? Are they embarrassed they failed to steal anything? Did they launch the attack which stranded the vox on Sif? I could speculate all day and get no closer to a definitive answer. As usual there’s likely more than meets the eye but no way to uncover the truth.</p>

<p><b>PCRU Saves Ullran Expanse (Special Report)</b></p>

<p>Several days back an explosion wracked the Ullran Expanse with enough force to trigger Richter scales all the way in New Reykjavik. Exactly what happened has made waves through the media here in Vir and beyond. Rumors and misinformation abound so we here at Starfire decided to set the facts straight.</p>
<p>The events begin with NanoTrasen’s NLS Southern Cross space station and a planned attack by the terrorist organization known as the Syndicate. NT has remained tight-lipped on the details here due to security concerns but revealed the plans were uncovered early enough to dispatch its “Preemptive Chaos Response Unit” (PCRU) before the Syndicate could launch the attack.</p>
<p>”Given the scope of what happened here we’re being as transparent as we can be without risking our intelligence teams. I might be stating the obvious but the Syndicate reads the news,” an official NT spokesperson was quick to respond to our requests for an interview. The full interview can be found on our exonet site. “I guess the simplest way to put it is the Syndicate built a giant experimental gun mech. And when I say giant, I mean the kind of thing you’d see on a USDF flagship. It was designed to blast space stations out of orbit from the planet’s surface. We still don’t know how the Syndicate transported this thing to the Ullran wilderness without us finding out about it but there it was, just a few hours away from blowing Southern Cross out of the sky. There’s no force on Sif which could’ve gotten to that thing with just a couple hours’ notice so we had to send the PCRU.”</p>
<p>A relatively new and secretive division of NanoTrasen’s Emergency Response Team, the PCRU specializes in tackling major threats before they become major emergencies. “The higher-ups weren’t all that keen on handing this over to the PCRU but ultimately we didn’t have a choice. Asset Protection wasn’t available to respond that quickly and the rest of the ERT was caught up with an attack on Northern Star. Probably a diversion in retrospect. But that’s what we have the PCRU for and why we were able to save Southern Cross. Just… well, thing is this was the biggest threat in the entire history of the PCRU. This was going to make or break the division’s existence.”</p>
<p>”I can’t really get into the details on the PCRU’s inner workings, only that they deal with very extreme threats. They did far better than anybody was expecting for a new program,” reported to consist of only three operatives, the PCRU disrupted the initial bombardment of NLS Southern Cross and recruited the station’s crew as a militia to destroy the heavily guarded Syndicate weapon. “Casualties were minimal, station damage was minimal, the crew didn’t try killing the PCRU. They just banded together and assaulted the weapon. The PCRU commander spoke highly of the crew and the bravery they displayed taking on a small Syndicate army. She recommended medals for everybody who joined the fight. Station’s still standing so that’s probably going to happen.”</p>
<p>When asked about the explosion and rumors of a nuclear bomb, the spokesperson laughed. “Yeah, Ullran didn’t get nuked and we can prove it because our outpost is still standing without a scratch. You’re probably going to want to ask VirGov about the details of the explosion once they’re done investigating because we don’t know the specifics. What we do know is the Syndicate bombed the area once the mech was destroyed, probably to try and kill our guys and obliterate the remains of the weapon. The damage is pretty serious but that’s what you get when people fund a terrorist organization. They wouldn’t think twice about poisoning all the waters of Sif to somehow get at us.”</p>
<p>Our requests for interviews with the VirGov officials carrying out the investigation of the Ullran investigation were declined. The VGA released an official statement stating NanoTrasen has shown full compliance so far in the investigation and is likely not culpable for the damage to the Ullran Expanse. The actions of Southern Cross’s crew were commendable and the PCRU squad responsible for destroying the mech may be considered for Vir Medals of Honor.</p>
<p>The PCRU squad similarly declined requests for interview but provided a message with a request we share it in place of a full interview. “I know everybody’s going to be disappointed we aren’t taking interviews over the Ullran incident but we’re busy, terrorist stuff like this doesn’t take a break for celebrations. Think is, we’re not the ones you should be clamoring to interview. We were just the leaders; the real heroes that day were the crew of Southern Cross. We would have died and lost the station on our own; the crew is why we’re celebrating instead of worrying about where the remains of Southern Cross will crash into Sif. These are ordinary civilians just like you who went above and beyond to thwart mass murder. You want somebody to praise and interview? Look among the crew because they are the ones who deserve your respect and awe.”</p>
