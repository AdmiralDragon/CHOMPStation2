<p><b>Try Out NT-VR Pods (Sponsored by NanoTrasen)</b></p>

<p>Ever wanted to fight in the thunderdome but afraid to lose life or limb? Still skeptical about resleeving technology despite our tried-and-true no-compromises quality assurance testing? Then we have just the product for you.</p>
<p>Introducing the NanoTrasen VR pod. Utilizing cutting edge replicant technology, the VR pod prints and grants the user control over a physical body rather than a virtual avatar.

No problem, you’ll wake up back in the pod ready to print a new body and get right back at it. At long last, take all those risky adventures you’ve been dying to try without fear of dying.*<p>
<p>*WARNING: VR pods provide 100% realistic body sensations and do not protect against mental trauma triggered by traumatic events.

<p><b>Trafficking Harem Reported in Vir</b></p>

<p>Reports emerged this weekend regarding a trafficking ring making rounds throughout Vir, allegedly lingering near Sif and Kara. Posing as a travelling harem, the ring reportedly lures patrons with promises of enjoyment then abducts anybody unable to pay the fee to leave.</p>
<p>”Such schemes frequently pop up among frontier systems,” stated a VirGov Public Services spokesperson. “Lack of SolGov policing often leaves frontier systems understaffed with upholding law and order. Thus ships like these pop up as it’s much easier for them to slip under our radar our here versus the core systems.”</p>
<p>VirGov is requesting anybody with information about the trafficking ring to contact the local authorities. The only released information so far Is the ring appears to be based out of a ship last seen orbiting Sif.</p>

<p><b>Realspace Instability Grows (Guest Interview)</b></p>

<p>Anomalous space-based fluctuations abound across Sif’s Ullran Expanse. While hardly a new phenomenon, a year-long study of the surrounding area reported a hundred-fold increase in bluespace turbulence over the course approximately six months.</p>
<p>”These numbers are unlike anything we’ve seen in a previously characterized area,” reported Shhokla Ezur, the lead author of the study. “While not unprecedented in a newly discovered or unmeasured location, we’ve never found such a spike in activity in somewhere as well-studied as Ullran. Curiously, the data suggest a link to NanoTrasen’s Southern Cross, though we lack data on the installation itself.”</p>
<p>Several commentators have been quick to draw a link between the study results and the anomalous occurrences at NLS Southern Cross. Perhaps further study will draw a definitive answer about the infrequent events.</p>
<p>The full interview can be found on our exonet site.</p>

<p><b>Assailants Battle Over Southern Cross</b></p>

<p>A firefight broke out across NLS Southern Cross this weekend, allegedly involving at least two rival mercenary factions. While NanoTrasen claims to have identified both groups, it has not offered an explanation as to why the factions targeted the station. According to crew reports, the factions apparently used the station to attack one another, treating the crew as collateral damage.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the station suffered heavy damage and casualties but reportedly less than typical. “The crew seemed to hold the line enough to fight back and deal damage to the invaders,” stated an official NT spokesperson. “We were alerted to the situation much earlier than usual and recorded less damage to the station. The ERT expected much more of a bloodbath.”</p>
<p>While not the first time Southern Cross has been a staging ground for battling mercenaries, the motives remain unclear. No faction has claimed credit for the battle, though it is worth noting the infamous Syndicate rarely takes credit for attacks which fail to deal tremendous damage to NanoTrasen installations.</p>

<p><b>Trafficking Targets NanoTrasen Crew</b></p>

<p>Reports of a trafficking ring targeting NLS Southern Cross surfaced yesterday, testing the facility’s lackluster security. Allegedly armed with teleportation devices, the perpetrators simply teleported hapless crew to a processing facility to be stripped and sold for ransom or as black-market goods. NanoTrasen maintains that any crew not recovered were resleeved but it remains unknown how many crew may now have other selves sold into slavery.</p>
<p>Commonly called “abductors,” such trafficking rings are rare on the frontier but not unheard of, resulting in many horror stories (somewhat rightfully) circulating about the fates of their victims. Whether or not such rings are part of a large organization is unknown but considered unlikely due to the rarity of such attacks.</p>
<p>The average person on Sif (or the Karan colonies, for that matter) has little to fear as such incursions are exceptionally rare outside of isolated locales. The average NT employee however would be rightfully afraid given the isolated nature of Southern Cross and the success of this weekend’s incursion. It will be up to NanoTrasen to prevent this from happening again; we all know how that will go.</p>
